    째 a big navigation menu \n

Navgation bar: \n
    * routlinks to all the pages \n
    - style the nav to have a comon nav bar \n
    - style a home page nav menu \n
Photo galary : \n
    * setup a fake api to have a test data for presentaition \n
    * save images in a json file \n
    * implement the fake api in the galary component \n
    째 Make the presentation of each photo with quick description and for what kind uses it cans be usefull \n

    - chose a general color style for the whole app (mabe a B/W style, or a more colored one)
    - Chose a fontstyle for menue and paragraphs
    - chose the frameworck Bulma VS Tailwind css (i've all ready used Bulma but ther is somme limitations and it needs to create our propore css classes for specific uses, but I am still in refelxion if it is a comercial plus or a production weakness.)
