# portfolio-photo

This project is a training project on my way to become a vue.js web dev.
Also I will use it to make a real photography portfolio because it is one of my other activity. 

So, here is a todo list of what I have to do on the projetct: 
(precision : 
    "-" means have to do 
    "°" means in progress 
    "*" means done 
) 

Home page : 
    - Logo/ or Profile photography 
    ° a big navigation menu 

Navgation bar: 
    * routlinks to all the pages 
    - style the nav to have a comon nav bar 
    - style a home page nav menu 
Photo galary : 
    * setup a fake api to have a test data for presentaition 
    * save images in a json file 
    * implement the fake api in the galary component 
    ° Make the presentation of each photo with quick description and for what kind uses it cans be usefull 

About me page: \n
    - write a pargraph presenting my parcour and who am I 
    - Add a photo of me 
    - Style the page to have the photo on the top and text above cenered 
    - also ad some background style 

About equipement page : 
    ° make the smae kind of galary but this time with a dedicated dataset of equipements stuff.

Style: 
    - chose a general color style for the whole app (mabe a B/W style, or a more colored one)
    - Chose a fontstyle for menue and paragraphs
    - chose the frameworck Bulma VS Tailwind css (i've all ready used Bulma but ther is somme limitations and it needs to create our propore css classes for specific uses, but I am still in refelxion if it is a comercial plus or a production weakness.)
