# portfolio-photo

This project is a training project on my way to become a vue.js web dev.
Also I will use it to make a real photography portfolio because it is one of my other activity.

So, here is a todo list of what I have to do on the projetct:

Home page :
    - Logo/ or Profile photographi
    - a big navigation menu

Navgation bar:
    - routlinks to all the pages (done)
    - style the nav to have a comon nav bar 
    -style a home page nav menu
Photo galary :
    - setup a fake api to have a test data for presentaition
        - create a sql or some kind of file to incorpore photos
    - Make the presentation of each photo with quick description and for what kind uses it cans be usefull

About me page:
    - write a pargraph presenting my parcour and who am I
    - Add a photo of me
    - Style the page to have the photo on the top and text above cenered
    - also ad some background style 

About equipement page :
    - make the smae kind of galary but this time with a dedicated dataset of equipements stuff.

Style: 
    - chose a general color style for the whole app (mabe a B/W style, or a more colored one)
    - Chose a fontstyle for menue and paragraphs
    - chose the frameworck Bulma VS Tailwind css (i've all ready used Bulma but ther is somme limitations and it needs to create our propore css classes for specific uses, but I am still in refelxion if it is a comercial plus or a production weakness.)
